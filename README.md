# liri-node-app
## Summary
This is a Node command line app that allows a user to make requests for data to Twitter, Spotify and OMDB.

### Notes
1. Because this is a Node CLI app, the repo must be cloned to a Node environment.
2. Be sure to run `npm install`
3. Try one of the following commands: `node liri.js my-tweets`, `node liri.js spotify-this-song <song title>`, `node liri.js movie-this <movie title>`, `node liri.js do-what-it-says`
4. `my-tweets` only pulls tweets from the dummy Twitter account set up to test this app.
5. `do-what-it-says` performs the command in random.txt.
